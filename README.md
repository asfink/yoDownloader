#yoDownloader

A Google Chrome extension that uses the YO! API. 

##Overview
This extension is for use when downloading a large file via the internet. The user will input a value that will be the minimum size to activate the extension. When the user downloads a file of the specified size or larger, the user will receive a YO! notifing them when the download is completed. 


##Issues
###September 17, 2014
As of right now, the main issue is that the Google Chrome API call for tracking download status and download information does not work. 


The options page is currently very buggy, however will be updated to work in the future.
